# SnapApp
Snapchat like app but instead of individually sending photots and videos we make it based around an event. 
So, say you go to a wedding you scan a QR code or passcode and are put into an album in the cloud. 
The album contians eveyone that has joined from the eventand their photos and videos. 
When the event is overe eveyone has a week or so to look over everyone's photos that were added and reminisce about the event and save photos or videos until it is all deleted a week after the event.
